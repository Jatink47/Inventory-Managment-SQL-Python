GROUP BY 1,2;
 ```
 - **Stored function to automate searching**
 
**1.Monthwise**
 ```sql
 delimiter //
CREATE PROCEDURE month_quantity (IN months VARCHAR(50))
BEGIN
  SELECT
    monthname(orderdate) AS month,
    sum(o.QuantityOrdered) AS quantity
    FROM customer as c
  JOIN order_details o ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
  WHERE
    monthname(orderdate) = months
  GROUP BY
    1;
END;
//
```

2.**Location wise**

```sql
delimiter //

CREATE PROCEDURE location_stock (IN locations VARCHAR(50))
BEGIN
  SELECT
    p.productname,
    i.QuantityAvailable,
    w.WarehouseName,
    w.location
  FROM warehouse w
    JOIN inventory AS i ON i.warehouseid = w.Warehouseid
    JOIN product AS p ON i.ProductID = p.ProductID
  WHERE w.location = locations;
END;
//
```

**3.ProductId wise** 

```sql
delimiter //

CREATE PROCEDURE product_location (IN productid VARCHAR(50))
BEGIN
  SELECT
    p.productname,
    i.QuantityAvailable,
    w.WarehouseName,
    w.location
  FROM warehouse w
    JOIN inventory AS i ON i.warehouseid = w.Warehouseid
    JOIN product AS p ON i.ProductID = p.ProductID
  WHERE p.productid = productid;
END;
//
```
- **Identify high-value customers who may be at risk of churning (no purchase in the last 6 months).**
```sql
WITH CustomerValueAndLastOrder AS (
  SELECT
    c.CustomerID,
    c.CustomerName,
    Round(SUM(od.QuantityOrdered * od.Price)/100000,2)AS TotalSpent,
    MAX(od.OrderDate) AS LastOrderDate
  FROM customer c
    JOIN order_details od ON c.CustomerID = od.CustomerID
  GROUP BY
    c.CustomerID,
    c.CustomerName
)
SELECT *
FROM CustomerValueAndLastOrder
WHERE LastOrderDate < (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 6 MONTH);

 ```

 - **What is the average time between orders for repeat customers**?
 ```sql
 WITH OrderedDates AS (
  SELECT
    CustomerID,
    OrderDate,
    LAG(OrderDate, 1) OVER (

      ORDER BY OrderDate
    ) AS PreviousOrderDate
  FROM (
      SELECT DISTINCT CustomerID, OrderDate
      FROM Order_Details
  ) AS sub
)
SELECT
  c.CustomerName,
  ROUND(AVG(DATEDIFF(OrderDate, PreviousOrderDate))) AS AvgDaysBetweenOrders

        PARTITION BY c.CategoryName 
        ORDER BY SUM(od.QuantityOrdered * od.Price) DESC
    ) AS RankInCategory
FROM Product p
JOIN Order_Details od 
    ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID
JOIN Category c 
    ON p.CategoryID = c.CategoryID
GROUP BY 
    c.CategoryName, 
    p.ProductID, 
    p.ProductName
ORDER BY 
    c.CategoryName, 
    RankInCategory;
```
- **Monthly Growth Rate** 

```sql
WITH MonthlySales AS (
  SELECT
    DATE_FORMAT(OrderDate, '%Y-%m') AS SalesMonth,
    SUM(QuantityOrdered * Price) / 100000 AS MonthlyRevenue
  FROM Order_Details
  GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(OrderDate, '%Y-%m')
)
SELECT
  SalesMonth,
   ROUND(MonthlyRevenue, 2) AS MonthlyRevenue,
  ROUND(
    ((MonthlyRevenue - LAG(MonthlyRevenue) OVER (ORDER BY SalesMonth)) 
     / LAG(MonthlyRevenue) OVER (ORDER BY SalesMonth)) * 100, 2
  ) AS GrowthRatePercent
FROM MonthlySales
ORDER BY SalesMonth;
```

- **CUSTOMER LIFE TIME VALUE** 

```sql
WITH CustomerSpending AS (
  SELECT
    c.CustomerID,
    c.CustomerName,
    CONCAT("Rs. ",ROUND(SUM(od.QuantityOrdered * od.Price)/100000,2)," Lakhs") AS TotalRevenue
  FROM
    Customer c
    JOIN Order_Details od ON c.CustomerID = od.CustomerID
  GROUP BY
    c.CustomerID,
    c.CustomerName
)
SELECT
  CustomerName,
  TotalRevenue AS CustomerLifetimeValue
FROM CustomerSpending
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;

```

##  Analysis Report 

[Analysis Report](https://github.com/Jatink47/Inventory-Managment-SQL-Python/blob/main/Business_Report_Inventory_Management.pdf)

## Final Recommendations
- Promote product bundles to increase average order value and move inventory faster.
- Fix reorder strategy to avoid stockouts/overstocking and align with actual sales velocity.
- Focus on top-selling products and reduce inventory/marketing spend on underperforming ones.
- Segment customers by buying frequency and send targeted reminders/offers before expected repurchase.
- Protect high-value customers (e.g., Beth Miller, Stephanie Leon) through loyalty programs and account management.
- Launch win-back campaigns for 49 churned high-value clients and investigate Sept/Oct 2024 churn drivers.
- Investigate the 53% October revenue drop to identify root causes (pricing, service, competition).\
- Grow mid- and low-value customers by designing targeted strategies to move them into higher-value segments.
